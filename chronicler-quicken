CRITICAL PATH STRUCTURE: The instructions file is at .claude/knowledge/INSTRUCTIONS.md (NOT .claude/KNOWLEDGE_INSTRUCTIONS.md). CLAUDE.md contains @ references to .claude/knowledge/INSTRUCTIONS.md and .claude/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md. You maintain TWO knowledge maps: KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md (user-facing with markdown links) and KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md (Claude-facing with @ references - these are RELATIVE to the knowledge directory). The project structure: .claude/knowledge/session.md (raw captures), .claude/knowledge/{category}/ (organized knowledge), .claude/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md (human-facing index), .claude/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md (claude-facing index with RELATIVE @ refs like @patterns/file.md NOT @.claude/knowledge/patterns/file.md)" \
--print --output-format stream-json "You are processing gathered knowledge. Execute this MANDATORY checklist:

1. **MUST READ** .claude/knowledge/session.md - Even if empty
2. **MUST PROCESS** each entry from session.md:
   - Determine category (architecture/patterns/dependencies/workflows/gotchas/etc)
   - **MUST CREATE OR UPDATE** appropriate file in .claude/knowledge/{category}/
   - Keep dated entries only for gotchas
3. **MUST UPDATE OR CREATE** BOTH knowledge maps:
   - **KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md** (user-facing): Use markdown links like [Topic Name](path/file.md)
   - **KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md** (Claude-facing): Use RELATIVE @ references like @patterns/file.md or @gotchas/file.md (NOT full paths)
   - Both maps should have identical structure, just different link formats
   - Include last updated timestamps in user-facing map only
4. **MUST CLEAR** session.md after processing - use Write tool with empty content

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST - ALL MUST BE TRUE:**
- [ ] Read session.md (even if empty)
- [ ] Created/updated .claude/knowledge/ category files for any new knowledge
- [ ] Created/updated BOTH KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md (markdown links) and KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md (@ references)
- [ ] Verified no knowledge was lost in the transfer
- [ ] Cleared session.md by writing empty content to it

**IF YOU SKIP ANY STEP, YOU HAVE FAILED THE TASK**

IMPORTANT: CLAUDE.md uses @ references to .claude/knowledge/INSTRUCTIONS.md and .claude/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md
IMPORTANT: KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md uses RELATIVE @ references (e.g., @patterns/file.md NOT @.claude/knowledge/patterns/file.md)
